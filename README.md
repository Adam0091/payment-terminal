# Payment terminal NextJS
Hi.:hand:
This project was made using TypeScript, NextJS, ReactHooks, Styled-Components and MongoDB


All providers are stored in the MongoDB database and you can always add a new one.
The payment request is emulated and returns a random execution result. If you do not see a payment error notification or a successful payment notification - be patient.:pray:
